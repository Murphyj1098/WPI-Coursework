Smart Stove Server Notes

HTTP Info:
    GET     - a request to the server that should only receive data from the server, no other effects
    POST    - a request to the server asking the server to accept data in the post request

ESP Web Server Address: "http://***.***.*.22:255"
Our network Address:    "http://**.***.***.114:255"

http://**.***.***.114:255/StoveState

    GET request

    responseContent (MIT App Dev Field)
    content type: "text/plain"
        "on"  - the stove is on
        "off" - the stove is off

    "on" and "off" strings can be used as boolean for any control logic


http://**.***.***.114:255/StoveMotor

    POST request

    PostText (MIT App Dev Field)
        text content does not matter, the POST request itself starts the motor routine


Note:
1.  The "when Web1.GotText" block will trigger on any POST or GET request
        - The responseContent of a POST should be ignored
        - The responseContent of a GET  is the content requested from the server

        (can use the "get url" in an if to compare if the text came from a GET or POST)
            - See example screenshot

2.  Using "set Web1.SaveResponse to true" allows the contentResponse to be saved to a file
        - The app can save the contentResponse of the StoveState GET to a file to keep track of the state
